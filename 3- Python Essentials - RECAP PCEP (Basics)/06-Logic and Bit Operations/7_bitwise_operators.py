##############    Python Bitwise Operators


print(6 & 3)
#The Bitwise & operator compares each bit and set it to 1
# if both are 1, otherwise it is set to 0:

The Bitwise ~ operator inverts each bit (0 becomes 1 
and 1 becomes 0).

Inverted 3 becomes -4:
 3 = 011
-4 = 100

Note:  ~x : This is the same as -x - 1.

-4-1 = -5
-5-1=-6
"""

print(3 << 4)

"""
The Bitwise << operator inserts the specified number
 of 0's (in this case 2) from the right and 
 let the same amount of leftmost bits fall off:

If you push 00 in from the left:
 3 = 011
becomes
12 = 1100

Note: x << y This is the same as multiplying x by 2**y.
         (x << y   ===> x * 2**y)

print(8 >> 4)

"""
The Bitwise >> operator moves each bit the specified
number of times to the right.
Empty holes at the left are filled with 0's.

If you move each bit 2 times to the right, 8 becomes 2:
 8 = 1000
becomes
 2 = 0010
 1 = 0001
