##############    Python Comparison Operators


#Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

x = 5
y = 3

#Equal
print(x == y)
# returns False because 5 is not equal to 3

#Not equal
print(x != y)
#returns True because 5 is not equal to 3

#Greater than
print(x > y)
# returns True because 5 is greater than 3

#Less than
print(x < y)
# returns False because 5 is not less than 3

#Greater than or equal to
print(x >= y)
# returns True because five is greater, or equal, to 3

#Less than or equal to
print(x <= y)
# returns False because 5 is neither less than or equal to 3
